      <h2>News</h2>
            <p>Nvidia has the same problem with their 50 series graphics cards as with their 40 series,
            the power connector is melting due to all the high power draw from the card. This is a 
            big faliure for Nvidia as they have not learned from their mistakes with the 40 series
            and it seems like they are rushing to get these cards out the door wothout proper testing.
            And they are also losing customers because of this issue. And a lot of those customers are 
            going for AMD's cards instead, which is not good for Nvidia as they are the market leadr in 
            graphics cards.this could lead to a shift in the market if Nvidia does not address this issue soon. and
            there is also no stock of the 50 series cards in stores like best buy, New egg, and Amazon, but the good news 
            are that Nvidia says that they are working hard to get more stock out to the retailers, but while they do it 
            we are going to have to pay a lot more money than what the MSRP of the graphics cards are.
      </p>
            <p>But from AMD's side we now have the Rx 9070 and Rx 9070xt, which is AMD's best launch in history because AMD
            finally has a card that can compete against Nvidia's graphics cards. Since the launch of these two graphics cards
            we have gotten a lot of positive feedback from the community and reviewers, and it seems that they are exellent 
            graphics cards for gaming and also for productivity.
